The bash script can be used for multi-gpu training on the compute canada cluster by running the following command:
> sbatch run.sh

Before submission to the compute canada cluster (or other clusters), please do the following steps:
1. Upload the ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof 2021 files to compute canada under your 'scratch' folder. In my case, they are named 'LA.zip' (the 2019 version) and 'ASVspoof2021_DF_eval_*.tar.gz' (the 2021 evaluation sets)
2. Clone the whole repository to your 'project' folder
3. Check all paths and make sure they are correct. 

The first few commented lines are specifying the hardware parameters, usually there is no need to change as they already meet the requirements for our experiments.
There is a commented line which specifies your email address, change it to your own so that you receive notification whenever the training starts and ends. Remove it if not needed.

You can access compute canada from anywhere on earth (theoretically), for more info please go to the Compute Canada website.

If wish to run the training scripts on your own machine, use the command 
> python ./exps/train.py ./exps/hparams/XXX.yaml

For any other questions about running this script on the cluster, please send me an email at Yi.Zhu@inrs.ca
